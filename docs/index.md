    Usually, a pull request replies to an issue, a feature, or a bug fix. Do not include dozens of code in a single pull request. Typically, 250 lines is the maximum of a single pull request (exceeding a little is acceptable).

Start a pull request after you have finished some coding. The code will be merged after the reviewers accepted your code.
